An anomaly within my portfolio, it contains all words that accompany the actual written images. 

What can be said about written images? Similar to poetry, but generally, poetry can stand by itself without the need of a drawn or painted picture. Written images are similar to China and Japan's Three Perfections. A fusion of three art forms that are delicately balanced together to bring the near-ultimate piece of creative work (near, because sound is missing).

For anyone else, it might be difficult to distinguish the difference between the concept of written images with the work of a graphic designer, illustrations with a caption, or simply, a poem with a picture. 
Still, I have trouble describing what really is a written image. It's a very new concept to me. I do not consider it simply "a poem with a picture", however. 
You can determine for yourself what this written image nonsense is, but you might be wrong. I wrote this on the first written image I made, and it's a very simplistic definition; judge yourself.

>A poem can have a (physical) image attached, but was the poem originally intended to have an image? If it wasn’t intended to have an image then it’s certainly a poem. If an image was in mind and then included, then there is a written image. 

I can guess the ultimate written image is physically being the image while speaking the words. Sound, physical, real. At that point it couldn't be called a written image, but the imagery is firmly manifested.
