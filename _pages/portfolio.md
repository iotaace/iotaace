## Black and White

Working in black and white is my favourite. The process of creating a black and white image reminds me of creating pixel artwork. Pixel art, with its inherent restrictions, requires anti-aliasing, dithering, and careful linework in order to make a smooth, crisp, and professional image. Rules must be followed within these techniques, making pixel art a rather rigid medium to work with.

The same goes for black and white work; luckily, there aren't any mathematical restrictions on the same calibre as pixel art. As there are imposed restrictions, clever methods need to be used to achieve the same amount of detail that a coloured image contains. Yet, B&W details are markedly of a different nature, containing a quality that is unknown and foreign to coloured works. Working with two colours (and, the third colour that stems naturally, gray) is the definition of working minimally, but creating deep impressions. 

Coloured work is liberated - black and white is unyielding. 
Working in B&W has taught me a lot of tricks; I'm still discovering more everytime I work in this medium. 

## Colour

We live in a world of colour, so it's only natural that humans desire to make colours close to the ones produced by nature (although, colour **is** relative). 
Generally speaking, most of us see more or less the same colours. The sky is blue, the grass is green ... the trees are brown, you're yellow, and I'm gray, etc.
I enjoy working with colour because it's an excellent way to show people **what** you mean, because for most individuals, colour is associated with a feeling or experience, or what have you. Whether or not you and your friend agree that red invokes imagery/words of power and passion, the fact is, colour is definitive in providing a connection from your brain to the world beyond your self. You could be a logical and technical person with a strong distaste for feelings in art, but your brain will make some sort of connection when you see (a) colour(s) in a painting.  

## Sketches

The best part of making work! The work before it was complete. It's a real treat for me to view an admired illustrator's sketches. It shows me how they got from the beginning to the end, and gives me confidence that I too, can finish my work.
Sketches aren't just restricted to visual works; video games, music, writing and much more all require the 'first beginnings' and gives you an idea of what the creator(s) were going for, and why. 

Personally, the very first sketch I draw is generally infantile in appearance. It's shocking that I start out with little details and somehow manage to finalize the idea. Guess the brain fills in the rest. 

Lastly, I'm always updating my portfolio with new artwork. So check up every week or two and there'll most likely be a newly added picture.
