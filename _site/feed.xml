    &lt;figcaption&gt;The other half of the process.
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, I was at a lost where to start, but I had to get over the mental block and go wild. I’d like to go wilder, but one has to be careful where to place the lines and shading as well (which is where the initial mental block arose). You can’t just place any line anywhere. And if you already made lines, in the line art base, it might not look right when you shade the picture. It’s better to have a fairly blank slate to work with, and simply transfer the image from your mind into the picture. Most importantly, the mental block has to be removed. You can’t think to yourself how the picture will look every second you place a line. Do it first and then look at it 5 minutes later. Erase if you don’t like it (hopefully not, because then 5 minutes are lost). I try to erase the least possible but sometimes I really don’t like the way I did a shading so I redo it all over again. A lot of time is lost doing this, but it gives my mind a ‘drug’ to calm down. I’m working on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This picture has been in my ‘file cabinet’ for several months. Most of the picture was completed in November. Once again, the mental block worked against me in the completing it, but I fought through this month and finally finished it thoroughly afterwards. The picture was first created Tuesday, October 27, 2015 … and finished at the end of January this month.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>ACE</name><email>acrane@oswego.edu</email></author><category term="process" /><category term="composition" /><category term="illustration" /><category term="marie" /><category term="lecoile" /><category term="space opera" /><category term="black and white" /><summary type="html">More of my characters from my sci-fi story.

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always manage to find time to work on my stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have for the longest time (many, many years), wanted to make a more ‘artistic’ piece, where the main colour was a blaring cerulean. A lot of times I let colour guide the entire process of the picture, and it can really change the way the picture was originally set out to be. The picture is the colour and it is entirely based on the colour. Without the colour, there’s no statement and no character, or story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cerulean piece in question: Sigmana (long hair) and Phirem (short hair), right when they are out of their artificial intelligence machines. Their mother is watching them from beyond with her unwavering glare. They are aliens, so they aren’t supposed to be beautiful. I want the eyes and lips and overall face to look weary for all of them. The mother has bulging eyes and long paper-thin eyelashes. I want to make the mother look as stoic but uncanny as possible. 
I thought I was going to do Sigmana and Phirem as line art, but then I experimented a little bit and figured doing an orange and blue paint of their silhouettes is best. Darker shadows of their bodies and garment will be the blue of the background. The mother will be the ‘prime’ target – bolder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;another-work-in-progress&quot;&gt;Another work in progress&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/content/nerve.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a work in progress which stirred from an idea I had two years ago. I had a dream and after I woke up; I sketched the picture. The character was in a weird cavern that was full of muscles, cells, nervous system … hair separated from the head. So I used my character Phirem. Phirem is an alien, a creation, so it’s impossible Phirem has the inners of a human or any kind of organic being but inorganic material circuiting through.
Right now it’s just a line art of the body but as you can see by this sketch:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/content/nerve_2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;after the body base will be completed, a layer will be drawn on top consisting of sinewy threads.  The body base is made so it will be easier … I need to remind myself not to make the line art ‘too’ perfect. Ctrl-z, draw, ctrl-z … repeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More on these as I continue to work through them.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>ACE</name><email>acrane@oswego.edu</email></author><category term="process" /><category term="composition" /><category term="illustration" /><category term="marie" /><category term="jessie" /><category term="sigmana" /><category term="phirem" /><category term="space opera" /><category term="art reference" /><category term="dream" /><category term="variance" /><category term="color design" /><category term="sketches" /><summary type="html">The latest work.

I’ve always wanted to do a picture of characters in 80s ski clothes. With my increasingly funky cel shading, I thought the 80s theme would fit well. The characters are from my sci-fi creation, Marie and Jessie. Jessie’s the one with the light blue hair; she’s an Andromedian. Marie’s the dark blue haired girl who has a penchant for mechanical work, and lives on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initial ski outfit inspiration was from some years ago, when I saw Takei Masaki’s artbook, Sotsugyou (Graduation). The illustrations were character designs of each girl you could get with in the PC98 game, Sotsugyou. Each girl had an illustration of her skiing, with funky outfits.  I love Takei Masaki’s hard, angular lines and shading. His peak was in the 90s, and following through into the 2000s; unfortunately, his modern artwork turned softer and much more vulgar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;half &quot;&gt;

        &lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/content/sketch2.png&quot; alt=&quot;revised sketch&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;/a&gt;
    
  
  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;These are the compositions for the picture.
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew I was going to give it a light blue background. It would also have a ‘present’ wrapped look, with diagonal blocks showcasing various text on the upper left and lower right sides of the pictures. Though, I wasn’t sure how I was going to pull that off, until much later in the process of the picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this was going to be an 80s retrospective picture, I looked up a lot of 80s ski images on google. I had to get an idea of how skis work, as well as what sort of position the body took. It had to be a dynamic image. Picking out the colours was the most exciting part. I wanted to use colours from an old computer palette, so I chose the MSX2. I did break away a little by selecting my own colours, so the image isn’t a true MSX2 colour palette. But this was a great exercise to get used to restriction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These were the original colours I thought of before using the palette … a placeholder to mark up some ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/content/sketch3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new colours. Most of the picture utilized the MSX2 palette.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/content/sketch4.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marie is a tomboy character while Jessie is a little more ‘feminine’ (but very bossy since she operates a touring spaceship hotel). I wasn’t positive a light pink ski suit would match Marie too well, but with her dynamic pose of jumping in the air in contrast to Jessie’s demure ‘gliding’, adds a boyish flair that neutralizes the pink costume. Both Marie and Jessie’s costume colours utilize the MSX2 palette. Marie’s symbol that I like to draw her with are stars, so I made sure to add that to her suit. Not only that, but the bright yellow with aqua gives a very 80s design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jessie’s costume colours are my favourite. The red and blue aren’t neon or saturated, but match the quality of 80s to early 90s ski costumes. More of the mountaineering, ruddy look rather than a fun costume. It’s legitimate; a real skier who wanted to appear slightly blazing fashionable would wear it. Her purple gloves are flamboyant and carefully match the red and blue theme. Avoidance of garish colour combos was a must; tasteful combinations were considered instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was stuck a little bit concerning the background, but what got me rolling was a snowflake brush I found after searching google. It seems once you find one thing, the rest comes naturally. ‘Welcome to 2016’ was given a neon glow, and rounded font common during the 70s and 80s (but less common after the 80s). The font does have a modern appearance; while this is a retrospective picture, it is also welcoming the transition to the New Year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The picture is like a thank you card, or a forgotten post card. I wasn’t born in the 1980s but the 80s mean a lot to me. Most of the things I like stem from the 80s and early 90s. This is one of my praises to that time period.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>ACE</name><email>acrane@oswego.edu</email></author><category term="process" /><category term="composition" /><category term="illustration" /><category term="marie" /><category term="jessie" /><category term="2016 new year's" /><category term="80s retrospective" /><category term="ski" /><category term="art reference" /><category term="MSX2" /><category term="Takei Masaki" /><category term="color design" /><summary type="html">In December, I had the bright idea of making a New Year’s picture.
