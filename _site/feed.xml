This is a bold and bizarre piece that I had sketched out back in August. But it was only in January this year that I completed it, thanks to time permitting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot; &quot;&gt;
  
    
      &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/gallery/radface3.png&quot; title=&quot;Variance Number 6&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/gallery/radface3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;/a&gt;
    
  
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common theme I like to draw are the twins, Sigmana and Phirem. I like to draw them because I can make them look disheveled, bizarre, unconventional. I’m tired of seeing artists draw characters that look like picture perfect models, and from the other side of the spectrum, uninteresting “shapes”. One of my influences for making the delicate creatures is Nagano Mamoru illustrations of his characters. Particularly, his Fatima’s look haunting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I tried to pick print safe colours, but, because I had this image on the backburner for months, I didn’t care when I picked it up again a few weeks ago. Nevertheless, I kept the palette at a minimum and chose vibrant, almost jarring colours. When I do a variance painting, I like to choose colours that may not work next to each other. Sometimes colours we think are disharmonious together, can be used to support or emphasize on another colour. I played it safe with this piece, though. Sigmana’s dull blue hair is a great contrast to the hot pink background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is another large image (6500 x 3300). A larger view is accessible through the gallery, in the portfolio section.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>ACE</name></author><category term="variance" /><category term="written image" /><category term="sigmana" /><category term="phirem" /><category term="sketches" /><category term="composition" /><category term="painting" /><summary type="html">I set this variance as the header for the splash page of my portfolio.

I’ve drawn them a lot, but the next pictures planned have nothing to do with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot; &quot;&gt;
  
    
      &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/gallery/thetwins3.png&quot; title=&quot;Twins&quot;&gt;

      &lt;/a&gt;
    
  
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I worked on this throughout December, and finished it in the beginning of January. It wasn’t a difficult piece; originally I was going to make it lineart, but after seeing how my painting looked without the lines, I decided to make it look realistic. I particularly like how Sigmana’s face turned out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since they are both artificially created, they aren’t supposed to look organic, though Phirem has quite an expressive personality. Sigmana is the prototype, or the ‘not as good as it could be’ type, so it’s going to look expressionless (Sigmana is well aware of its existence, however).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their skin colour is a sickly blue, with some signs of ‘life’ around their eyes (pink).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;phirem&quot;&gt;Phirem&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I struggled a lot with making Phirem’s face. I looked at references of mischevous children and fortunately, that helped. Still, to get a certain emotion out of its face was a challenge, and I am pleased with the result. Here are some sketches of what the twins looked like before. When I have difficulty, I will sketch many, many times until I get it right, or I do a study in which I practice a reference. This way, I am learning how to apply it to my own piece, as well as learning how to draw [a certain thing].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;setting-the-tone&quot;&gt;Setting the tone&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a very simple piece. Another written image, similar to the Jellyfish. One can say it’s the grownup version of the standard child’s drawing of a hill, house, sun, tree and stick figure, due to the horizontal composition. Much of the inspiration came from a dedicated video of Tuxedomoon’s piece “Lowlands Tone Poem”, and a house I would walk by as I went to the grocery store. The house looked standard of the area where my university is located; shabby, but it had a unique charm to it: many sunflowers right out front. I thought, ‘this house is not American’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;his-emotions&quot;&gt;His emotions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His appearance here amongst the minimal setting fleshes his personality completely. He isn’t depressed, and he isn’t a sad fellow. He isn’t happy either. He just is what he is. I think that’s the best way to live life, not to have so many ups and downs. Going through life as an active observer and aware of your environment, you tend to be content, forgiving of other people, and generally an easy going person. These types of individuals are not wishy-washy; they aren’t ecstatic, nor wild or morose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;background-on-the-creation&quot;&gt;Background on the creation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the creation of the image: the image is huge - 4748 x 3500 pixels. Not a good idea to draw this large with black and white work. It took a very long time and at some points, the work was exceedingly tedious and painful. Drawing each individual sunflower was a pretty bad experience. I spent a few weeks mulling over how I would plan out the sunflowers and I had difficulty drawing them at first (after some practice, I figured out my way of drawing these bright flowers). I was frustrated, and kept flip flopping between not including the flowers in the picture. I wagered the picture simply is not the same without the sunflowers – after all, it is my primary inspiration for the piece. After the initial line work was complete, the drawing went smoothly. To make the effect of the body of the sunflower, I simply laid over a noise layer. There’s no way I’d do each individual dot for each sunflower. Pure masochism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was going to be a street lamp, but maybe it would crowd the picture. On a second thought, perhaps I should have added it. There’s also no blue shed either, though I imagine he’s coming close to it. The priority was on the sunflowers and sky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, I too walk with an umbrella and briefcase.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>ACE</name></author><category term="black and white ink" /><category term="written image" /><category term="fantasy man" /><category term="process" /><category term="sketches" /><category term="lineart" /><category term="composition" /><category term="sunflower black and white" /><category term="noise" /><summary type="html">this piece is enourmous: 4748 x 3500. best viewed in full screen; please view it in the gallery as well!</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Written Image: Jellyfish</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/written%20image/jellyfish/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Written Image: Jellyfish" /><published>2016-09-13T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2016-09-13T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/written%20image/jellyfish</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/written%20image/jellyfish/">&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-jellyfish&quot;&gt;2 Jellyfish&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-rest&quot;&gt;The rest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago I wrote about jellyfish. I’m not going to say this is a poem – I won’t claim I can write poetry. Instead, I wrote an image on jellyfish. Images are different from poems … I think my goal was to create something that moves, rather than crafting with words. By this word ‘written image’, I mean the qualitative characteristics of what an image, which is a visual representation of a thing, provides. Think of the term ‘written image’ as something more technical and abstract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-a-written-image-in-my-terms&quot;&gt;What is a written image (in my terms)?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual, words weren’t enough, so I decided to take writing an image literally: drawing an image (now, I use the term ‘image’ with the basic connotation: visual representation). That’s what makes a written image complete. A poem can have an image attached, but was the poem originally intended to have an image? If it wasn’t intended to have an image then it’s certainly a poem. If an image was in mind and then included, then there is a written image. Take note that the words are also a part of the drawing. It’s not in a random space on the page, but blending with the jellyfish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is what a written image is, summed up in a basic manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an addition to this post, my portfolio would not be complete without the actual drawing. Here’s the jellyfish without the written image. I am pleased with the line work. I drew the jellyfish in a quick manner; about two hours total. I kept the shading and bw work at a minimum because that would obscure the very delicate line work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each time I look at this picture I get the sense of – dryness –. Certain amount of ugliness. There’s enough vibrancy to ensure this picture will gather the attention of those that enjoy neon colour schemes, but it is subdued by the dull background – pale mauve, gray periwinkle and a midnight blue: light enough to share the same space with the mauve and periwinkle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is also my first definite picture to incorporate only CMYK values. They were selected from the Pantone +CMYK library. It worked pretty well. This was the palette I worked with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/content/september/palette.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only colour I didn’t use was the light green. 
I proofed the image, and only the green in the man’s cloak dulls a tad; the green was mixed too much with the blue while painting, so the green, which is greenish-blue, does not properly come out when switched to CMYK. The rest of the colours keep consistent.
The initial concept came from a sketch I drew in an old sketch book of mine, back in 2014. I probably sketched it in one of my art classes and I was going to eventually plan it out as an image but I never did. The character is Wolfe, a shape shifter. Two years later, and here is a much nicer rendition of the original. I do not have this sketch book with me currently so no scan of the original is available. 
A black and white creation of the image might be done.&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve spent too much time with black and white so I am lacking. With this piece, I decided to use my Variance style, twisting it to make it less abstract. More importantly, this is a concept character design (that I redid three times) and was great colouring practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;space-detective-brom&quot;&gt;Space Detective Brom&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/gallery/brom2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is Brom, a concept art of a character. He’s a space detective and has a cyborg eye. Well I didn’t want the eye to look so mechanical and average. So it’s simply blue, though his eye changes colours depending on what wavelength he needs to hone in on. Blue is for visible light. He looks pretty regular as far as detectives go, besides his hair. I realized too late that his hair bears a little resemblance to Professor Oak… Ahh, well I did want Brom to have a ‘cyberpunk’ hair style. Sleek hair is popular in fashion today, but not popular with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;overlay-manipulation&quot;&gt;Overlay manipulation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another good practice was overlay manipulation to get some above standard effects. It was boring with just the colouring. I like the texture I gave to the coat, as well as some dirt to the shoes.
There were a lot of revisions with this picture. Check them out here (this was the cause for the unbelievable long time it took to finish his design):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/gallery/redandiota_flipped.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is another black and white image. It seems like I am trying to avoid colour images. Well, not with the last… (Variance Number 4).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, the good thing that I’ve noticed is that I am doing these black and white images a lot quicker. The linework still takes time, but the actual blacking in is taking less and less each picture. This one was an easy one though I had worked on it for several weeks, on and off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favourite part of the image? The galaxy in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Red and Iota, the leaders of the Rebel group, until Red (the guy with the long hair) goes on a mission somewhere else. Iota on the other hand, is not as charismatic, hardly, making for a bad leader. He is austere, deep in thought and generally not a great Andromedian to chat with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this picture I wanted to incorporate more design. Originally it wasn’t going to have the black borders nor the value, however I was itching to make more out of this piece. It looked boring without the value and borders. This now closes it and makes it polished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the original sketch. I had forgotten the galaxy was going to be titled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/content/sigmanathumbnail.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not here not there, not where.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sigmana is the feature. This stemmed from a montage of sketches I wanted to do of Sigmana and Phirem. This one was a sketch I wanted to completely develop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/content/sigmanasketch.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I retained the sketchy background, though reducing the opacity to 39%. It gives it a good edge, messy, gritty, rich. It’s too smooth without it. And I like the way the orange clashes with the red, though the red mixes with the weak blue carefully. The weak blue is on a different saturation level from the red, but the red pops within the confines of the blues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original size of the image is huge: &lt;strong&gt;4000 x 4800&lt;/strong&gt;. But here it’s down to 11% of its original size. Additionally a few adjustments to the originals curves allowing the light to be equal amongst the darks was done.&lt;/p&gt;

There were a lot of mental ebbs and flows during the first half of June.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/gallery/jessieticket_transparent.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is Cruise Captain Jessie (space opera character). Jessie, in a more caricature depiction, is in an earlier post titled 80s Retrospective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jessie is an Andromedian, and is a licensed Cruise Captain. She operates her own cruise line business with her own ship named Enlighters. Most people in my space opera world can teleport to wherever they want between MWG, Andromeda and Triangulum (as long as they teleport to the proper points of references that are accepted by the computer systems) but relaxing cruises throughout space is big business. People from all over it love it, and they can casually communicate with other species which is not often available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enlighters cruises between Milky Way and Andromeda. Usually, the ship follows its own unique course and it teleports to a set of progressed points in its journey, where it cruises for a certain amount of time, highlighting some celestial objects, then teleports to the next point to speed up; at the end, it retraces its path and ends up at the docking station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ship is massive and is almost like a planet in the nature that it has everything that can please the space tourists. It has to please tourists from alien and like cultures. Typically Enlighters cruise duration is one week. There are off seasons when the ship needs to be repaired or updated. Actually, Jessie’s ship is acting as an outdated model, but its internals have been updated. Passengers have always been charmed by Enlighters old world quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enough of talking about the ship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My idea with the picture was to make it like a photo you see in a magazine or brochure. The cruise pass is in that shape, just larger and with a glaring advertisement on the face. Cruise Captain Jessie is next to it. Her hat has always been based off of aviation but her suit is navy like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is her rough outfit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/content/june/roughcoloursjessie.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Realistic’ meaning her hair is not as light blue as it was in the cartoon like version in the linked article above. Generally, when I want to make something serious I make sure the colours aren’t over the top unless it truly is part of that character’s personality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, it’s another black and white picture to practice black and white. A coloured version wouldn’t be a bad idea, but I have to move on to other pictures that need to be done.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>ACE</name></author><category term="black and white" /><category term="design process" /><category term="illustration" /><category term="space opera" /><category term="jessie" /><category term="lineart" /><category term="how to draw black and white" /><category term="process" /><category term="composition" /><summary type="html">Just took too long for something so simple.

&lt;figure class=&quot; &quot;&gt;
  
    
      &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/gallery/mima_full.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Mima&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/gallery/mima_full.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;mima&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;/a&gt;
    
  
  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;ZUN’S PC-98 Mima
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This picture I am working on is actually fan art. I hardly do fan art. The last time I did fan art was a while ago. The reason why I don’t draw fan art is because I don’t like devoting time to drawing another creator’s character(s). I rather spend that time working on creating my own stuff. It’s just not fun to draw someone else’s character(s), even though there are tons of character designs I really like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I like Mima a lot, and because ZUN doesn’t give the players much to work with (design wise), I wanted to do a Mima picture. Mima’s design isn’t built out since she was made in the beginning days of Touhou, so it’s a lot of fun to ‘redo’ a design, or ‘add on’ to an existing design. Adding your own flair to the character.
This illustration and design of Mima probably wouldn’t be popular with Touhou fan-fans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-create-depth&quot;&gt;How to create depth?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not going to discuss this with artistic terms. Creating work is a kinesthetic operation mixed with a visual bent, so there is no need to mix in terms art majors and teachers of art use. The best way for me to explain the operation of creating definition with black and white is to translate the raw practicality to raw words.
When making black and white works, you need to approach the art differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ask, “How can I create depth with just black and white?”
What techniques do you like to use when you draw, or paint? Use those in a practice work, but exclude the colour. For those that work in colour often, trapped is a good word for what one might feel when using limited palette, but black and white can be easier than using a limited colour palette.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I start a black and white picture I keep it simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt; Sketch
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt; Sketch double over
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;3.&lt;/strong&gt; Sketch triple over
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4.&lt;/strong&gt; Sketch __ over until lineart can be drawn without erasing or fixing lineart errors
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;5.&lt;/strong&gt; Thicken lineart if needed&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But also, don’t trap yourself. Make as many layers as you want to ensure you will have freedom in your lineart. I never do lineart on one layer. For me, it’s a very claustrophobic feeling. When the hair layer is separate from the face, and I don’t like the hair layer, then I can delete the hair or erase the hair without worrying that it’ll impact other layers. This freedom helps break down any tense feelings. Tense feelings can destroy the process of creating a work. In order to create a work you have to flow with it. No rigidity in yourself. This principle is relevant to any of the creative processes, whether it’s making a sculpture, or creating a piece of music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/content/may/mimaroughs.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;avoid-unnecessary-lines-in-black-and-white-lineart&quot;&gt;Avoid unnecessary lines in black and white lineart&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When making lineart for a black and white picture, I advise not putting any unnecessary lines. Unnecessary lines will bother the freedom of adding the definition. When you have unnecessary lines, you might unconsciously or consciously adhere to the form of those lines. You want an absolutely clean and clear white unobstructed by these unnecessary lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example of unnecessary lines to the base line art, are lines on a person’s face, such as when they smile, or wrinkles… things like that. Hair strands within the hair, clothing folds. You shouldn’t put these into the base lineart. Severely minimize them to the best of your ability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;free-form&quot;&gt;Free Form&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, in my Mima picture, I do not put hair lines into her hair. It took me awhile to not insert unnecessary lines in my work. 
At first, it’s hard to not put these unnecessary lines in, and it’s hard to work ‘free form’ (no lines except the outer lines for the line art that displays the base of the work). And of course, some of you might have easily surpassed this or never had a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can’t work ‘free form’, then create the unnecessary lines on a separate layer. Lower the opacity of that layer and work with it. Eventually, you should train yourself to do free form. 
The process of free form requires:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt; Practice
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt; Visual knowledge&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to learn how to do a person’s face without adding the unnecessary lines, study faces and practice without adding the lines. After a few bouts of practice it gets easier. Your work will look a lot better too. Unnecessary lines look awful most of the time.
We have just discussed one step to creating definition.
However, the next step will be the ‘anti-freeform’. It requires making lines to create some definition, though not quite like the unnecessary lines in the above paragraphs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;anti-freeform&quot;&gt;Anti-freeform&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lines you make in this step are needed in order for definition to come forth. Think of this step as the colouring process after making your sketch, or base. Except, you are colouring with black. It just can’t be called colouring, technically, because it’s using black and white. It also can’t technically be called inking because we are assuming this is being done digitally (but if not, then it certainly is inking). Still, you can cal it whatever you’d like. I just think of it as the next process in completing the work.
The anti-freeform lines are best explained in visuals. The face and hands are a good start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/content/may/hand1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Remember:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; the purpose of avoiding these lines in the base lineart is because the picture is not set in stone. Things need to flow in a logical manner. Adding lines in the base lineart will impact the liquidity of how well you can manipulate the last process (adding the definition by ‘colouring’, ‘inking’ (whatever you want to call it)). Add step by step. Make your steps but adhere to the steps. That is the secret to finishing the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/content/may/face1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice I filled in the eyes after I was done with the base lineart. Does such a minute detail matter? To answer that question, read the above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few lines in the base lineart. They are minimal and were added in confidence. Furthermore, I knew exactly what to do with those lines. I accented their appearance. While you must be minimal in your unnecessary lines, remember that not all lines are unnecessary, especially if you are confident and know what you’re doing. 
To illustrate unnecessary lines better, here is the comparison with the character’s hair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/content/may/hairzoom.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A zoom in a certain area I deem an ‘unnecessary line’. It impacted my ability to complete the hair successfully. It should have been drawn after the base lineart; it doesn’t match with the rest of the lineart. Some harmony has been lost in the base lineart because of just one error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, why is this part of the hair not considered an unnecessary line?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/content/may/hair3zoom.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because this hair is flowing out from the main hair piece. So, it’s alright in comparison to the previous example.
These examples will help you understand what I mean by unnecessary lines. Ultimately, it’s your judgement. If you have a good eye for what causes a disturbance in your picture, you will know, but only if you have a good eye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;concluding-remarks&quot;&gt;Concluding remarks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, try these steps out and then manipulate them to the way you work, because one should never limit their selves to a certain process or style. When you learn to manipulate techniques, you will create your own style, visually and mentally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt; Remove unnecessary lines/ do not incorporate them into line art
&lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt; Line art must be against crisp clean white background
&lt;strong&gt;3.&lt;/strong&gt; Apply anti-freeform to create the actual depth 
&lt;strong&gt;4.&lt;/strong&gt; Use your judgement&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>ACE</name></author><category term="black and white" /><category term="design process" /><category term="illustration" /><category term="tutorial" /><category term="lineart" /><category term="how to draw black and white" /><category term="creating artistic definition" /><category term="process" /><category term="composition" /><summary type="html">In commemoration of spending 8 hours and 25 mins total on all 5 of my final exams for this semester, I’m going to write a short entry on creating definition with black and white work, using my Mima fanart example.</summary></entry></feed>
