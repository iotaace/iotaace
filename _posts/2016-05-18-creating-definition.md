In commemoration of spending 8 hours and 25 mins total on all 5 of my final exams for this semester, I’m going to write a short entry on creating definition with black and white work, using my Mima fanart example.

{% include gallery id="gallery" caption="ZUN'S PC-98 Mima" %}

## Background

This picture I am working on is actually fan art. I hardly do fan art. The last time I did fan art was a while ago. The reason why I don’t draw fan art is because I don’t like devoting time to drawing another creator’s character(s). I rather spend that time working on creating my own stuff. It’s just not fun to draw someone else’s character(s), even though there are tons of character designs I really like.
 
But I like Mima a lot, and because ZUN doesn’t give the players much to work with (design wise), I wanted to do a Mima picture. Mima’s design isn’t built out since she was made in the beginning days of Touhou, so it’s a lot of fun to ‘redo’ a design, or ‘add on’ to an existing design. Adding your own flair to the character.
This illustration and design of Mima probably wouldn’t be popular with Touhou fan-fans.

## How to create depth?

I’m not going to discuss this with artistic terms. Creating work is a kinesthetic operation mixed with a visual bent, so there is no need to mix in terms art majors and teachers of art use. The best way for me to explain the operation of creating definition with black and white is to translate the raw practicality to raw words.
When making black and white works, you need to approach the art differently. 

Ask, “How can I create depth with just black and white?”
What techniques do you like to use when you draw, or paint? Use those in a practice work, but exclude the colour. For those that work in colour often, trapped is a good word for what one might feel when using limited palette, but black and white can be easier than using a limited colour palette. 

When I start a black and white picture I keep it simple. 

**1.** Sketch
<br>
**2.** Sketch double over
<br>
**3.** Sketch triple over
<br>
**4.** Sketch __ over until lineart can be drawn without erasing or fixing lineart errors
<br>
**5.** Thicken lineart if needed

But also, don’t trap yourself. Make as many layers as you want to ensure you will have freedom in your lineart. I never do lineart on one layer. For me, it’s a very claustrophobic feeling. When the hair layer is separate from the face, and I don’t like the hair layer, then I can delete the hair or erase the hair without worrying that it’ll impact other layers. This freedom helps break down any tense feelings. Tense feelings can destroy the process of creating a work. In order to create a work you have to flow with it. No rigidity in yourself. This principle is relevant to any of the creative processes, whether it’s making a sculpture, or creating a piece of music.

## Avoid unnecessary lines in black and white lineart

When making lineart for a black and white picture, I advise not putting any unnecessary lines. Unnecessary lines will bother the freedom of adding the definition. When you have unnecessary lines, you might unconsciously or consciously adhere to the form of those lines. You want an absolutely clean and clear white unobstructed by these unnecessary lines. 

An example of unnecessary lines to the base line art, are lines on a person’s face, such as when they smile, or wrinkles… things like that. Hair strands within the hair, clothing folds. You shouldn’t put these into the base lineart. Severely minimize them to the best of your ability. 

## Free Form

For example, in my Mima picture, I do not put hair lines into her hair. It took me awhile to not insert unnecessary lines in my work. 
At first, it’s hard to not put these unnecessary lines in, and it’s hard to work ‘free form’ (no lines except the outer lines for the line art that displays the base of the work). And of course, some of you might have easily surpassed this or never had a problem.

If you can’t work ‘free form’, then create the unnecessary lines on a separate layer. Lower the opacity of that layer and work with it. Eventually, you should train yourself to do free form. 
The process of free form requires:

**1.** Practice
<br>
**2.** Visual knowledge

If you want to learn how to do a person’s face without adding the unnecessary lines, study faces and practice without adding the lines. After a few bouts of practice it gets easier. Your work will look a lot better too. Unnecessary lines look awful most of the time.
We have just discussed one step to creating definition.
However, the next step will be the ‘anti-freeform’. It requires making lines to create some definition, though not quite like the unnecessary lines in the above paragraphs.

## Anti-freeform

The lines you make in this step are needed in order for definition to come forth. Think of this step as the colouring process after making your sketch, or base. Except, you are colouring with black. It just can’t be called colouring, technically, because it’s using black and white. It also can’t technically be called inking because we are assuming this is being done digitally (but if not, then it certainly is inking). Still, you can cal it whatever you’d like. I just think of it as the next process in completing the work.
The anti-freeform lines are best explained in visuals. The face and hands are a good start.

**_Remember:_** the purpose of avoiding these lines in the base lineart is because the picture is not set in stone. Things need to flow in a logical manner. Adding lines in the base lineart will impact the liquidity of how well you can manipulate the last process (adding the definition by ‘colouring’, ‘inking’ (whatever you want to call it)). Add step by step. Make your steps but adhere to the steps. That is the secret to finishing the process.

Notice I filled in the eyes after I was done with the base lineart. Does such a minute detail matter? To answer that question, read the above. 

There are a few lines in the base lineart. They are minimal and were added in confidence. Furthermore, I knew exactly what to do with those lines. I accented their appearance. While you must be minimal in your unnecessary lines, remember that not all lines are unnecessary, especially if you are confident and know what you’re doing. 
To illustrate unnecessary lines better, here is the comparison with the character’s hair.

<img src="{{ stuffostuff.com }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/content/may/hairzoom.png" alt="">

A zoom in a certain area I deem an ‘unnecessary line’. It impacted my ability to complete the hair successfully. It should have been drawn after the base lineart; it doesn’t match with the rest of the lineart. Some harmony has been lost in the base lineart because of just one error. 

Now, why is this part of the hair not considered an unnecessary line? 

<img src="{{ stuffostuff.com }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/content/may/hair3zoom.png" alt="">

Because this hair is flowing out from the main hair piece. So, it’s alright in comparison to the previous example.
These examples will help you understand what I mean by unnecessary lines. Ultimately, it’s your judgement. If you have a good eye for what causes a disturbance in your picture, you will know, but only if you have a good eye.

## Concluding remarks

In summary, try these steps out and then manipulate them to the way you work, because one should never limit their selves to a certain process or style. When you learn to manipulate techniques, you will create your own style, visually and mentally.

**1.** Remove unnecessary lines/ do not incorporate them into line art
**2.** Line art must be against crisp clean white background
**3.** Apply anti-freeform to create the actual depth 
**4.** Use your judgement
