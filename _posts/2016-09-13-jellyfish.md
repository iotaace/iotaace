## 2 Jellyfish

## The rest 
A few weeks ago I wrote about jellyfish. I’m not going to say this is a poem – I won’t claim I can write poetry. Instead, I wrote an image on jellyfish. Images are different from poems … I think my goal was to create something that moves, rather than crafting with words. By this word ‘written image’, I mean the qualitative characteristics of what an image, which is a visual representation of a thing, provides. Think of the term ‘written image’ as something more technical and abstract.

## What is a written image (in my terms)?
 
As usual, words weren’t enough, so I decided to take writing an image literally: drawing an image (now, I use the term ‘image’ with the basic connotation: visual representation). That’s what makes a written image complete. A poem can have an image attached, but was the poem originally intended to have an image? If it wasn’t intended to have an image then it’s certainly a poem. If an image was in mind and then included, then there is a written image. Take note that the words are also a part of the drawing. It’s not in a random space on the page, but blending with the jellyfish. 

That is what a written image is, summed up in a basic manner. 

As an addition to this post, my portfolio would not be complete without the actual drawing. Here’s the jellyfish without the written image. I am pleased with the line work. I drew the jellyfish in a quick manner; about two hours total. I kept the shading and bw work at a minimum because that would obscure the very delicate line work.
