    title: WIP Empty Parking Lot 
---

This is a work in progress for the written image titled "Empty Parking Lot". 

The full written image of Empty Parking Lot can be read [here](/text/empty/)

This is half of the image that is part of Empty Parking Lot. I actually lost the second sketch, which would detail the empty parking lot, so I have to redraw it.

This is an actual dream I had, where it started at the bookstore and at one point, at a time of 4 AM (in the dream), there was an empty parking lot. I won't go into detail of this dream, but it was another story dream I tend to have.

I attempted to accurately draw the entrance to the bookstore from my dream, but it's not 100% what it looked like. Plus, the dream was in colour ... the bookstore was a hazy red colour, while the outside was that warm yellow glow you would find in cozy towns on a night out (though, I've never been on a 'night out'). And what else is missing are the two people, but leaving the composition barren of humanity makes the picture give an aura of emptiness. I still think about adding the person.

I mulled over whether the picture was going to be B&W or colour, but I decided on keeping my written images consistent: B&W it is!!

Been drawing too many B&Ws but a colour image is in the works.
