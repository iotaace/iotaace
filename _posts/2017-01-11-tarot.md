*This was a tarot reading I wrote for a customer back in October 9. It also contains valuable insights into the tarot and spirituality as a whole.*

## The reading

Kelly, I am very excited to delve deep into your love reading. You shared a good, brief description and a wonderful question. That helps a reader a lot because it enables me to jangle the Tarot into giving me deeper knowledge about the relationship you have with the man you love. 
Your question was,

“Was Carl and I soul mates in a past life, or will there be something for us in our future?”
I decided to reword it and add more substance for the Tarot; cushion it a little bit, because the Tarot likes specifics.
“Tarot, please give me insight as to whether Carl and Kelly were soul mates in a past life, or at least, is there the possibility of a relationship between the two, in the future?”

The cards were drawn in a basic but powerful spread: _past_, _present_, and _future_.

## BACKGROUND
_Past: 9 of Wands_
<br>
_Minor Arcana_


The card of perseverance. Sometimes I view this card as earthy, like a Pentacle, because of the amazing strength the man has. After being beaten down until he’s wrapped in bandages, he continues the path he is on ever vigilantly. The eight other wands serve as a barrier for his psyche and body. He uses it to fence himself in, so he’ll avoid getting hurt one more time. That doesn’t mean he’s giving up, though. It’s wise for him to do this, because people can only take so much of distraught caused by various situations.

The man needs to be careful not to block everything from entering his sphere. This is harmful in relation to new relationships, for example. For example, some people who have been deeply scarred by past relationships usually guard themselves from a new prospect of love; this only worsens any future relationships the person can have. The man should keep his stamina, and as long as he is wise in his watchful nature, he will be able to discern who is giving a hand, or is trying to stir another would to his heart. 

This card has a different meaning for you, however. The meaning is fully discussed in the “RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ALL THREE” section of this analysis.  

_Present: The Empress_
<br>
_Major Arcana_

Number three of the Major Arcana, The Empress is the ultimate card signifying the feminine nature of everything. The card even has the symbol of female etched onto a rock. That etching is commonly associated with Venus, the feminine character of humanity; the lover, the embodiment of the Western Female. The Empress proudly sits on a luxurious chair that is very comfortable. As you can see, there are pillows and blankets which cover the hard stone the chair is sitting on top of. She lives in comfort and as a person, makes the home; the mother figure. She makes everything comfortable for her residents and people outside of her sphere. Notice the wheat at the bottom of her feet. Water is flowing from the distance, into the wheat to keep it growing. Wheat signifies harvest, and in Paganism, the harvest time as always been associated with fertility. This fertility reinforces the motherly figure this card exudes. 

In terms of love, and in the present condition, the Empress is a good card to see. It says you are carrying a huge amount of love within yourself for someone else, but you don’t just want to keep it. The Empress doesn’t keep; if she did, why would she have a bountiful harvest beneath her feet? That is food to give to others. Your bountiful love you harbor inside is just aching to be transferred to someone else. 

 
_Future: Wheel of Fortune_
<br>
_Major Arcana_

This has always been an oddball of a card! It is one of the most ambiguous Major Arcana. But to sum up, it’s the card of destiny! Destiny or fate, is much like a wheel of fortune, wouldn’t you think? That is, if you believe in fate being entirely up to the gods or the universe or whatever there is that controls “the hands of fate”, as has been said thousands of times before. The hands of fate change your current situation. That is why it’s a wheel of fortune. It’s not a literal ‘fortune’, because we know fate can break or make us. The Wheel keeps our lives moving, and always changing. There is a lot of symbolism going on in this card and it can be rather overbearing at times when reading. The Wheel is in the clouds. The Wheel is part of divinity, not humanity. This is sensible, since sometimes fate isn’t always up to us. There is an angel, ox, lion, snake, eagle, 

Regarding love, I would say this is extremely interesting to find in your future position. Most likely, it will mean a change in your love life. Whatever it is, you’ll see a transformation occur to you. But, you do not know what kind of transformation the WOF is going to bestow you … or more like, what place the perpetually cycling wheel is going to end up on!

## ELEMENTS

In this reading, there is a fire card in the past position. As I explained in my last reading to you, Wands are very active, but this particular card, the Nine of Wands (9W), has a subtle nature to it. 
The next two cards are Empress in the present, and Wheel of Fortune in the future. Both are Major Arcana’s, but they have elements attached as well. I tend to associate Empress with air, since she is like Venus, and Venus in Western astrology is Libra (an air sign). However, she has an earthy feel to her, so she is a dual elemental card. The positives and negatives of each element play with each other. Earth is stubborn and grounded, but air lifts that austerity and allows it to free certain inhibitions. Air is always changing ways; sometimes can’t pick one thing over the other. Go east or west? But earth keeps air on a steady current.
The Empress has the best of both worlds because of these two polarizing yet complimentary elements.
WOF is divine rather than a physical elemental. The consensus among most Tarot readers is WOF invokes the fire element. However I personally think it’s difficult to see it as such, which is why I’ve made it a Divine Card. It is beyond and above any physical substance.  

It’s interesting because in your last reading we saw you received a 5W (Five of Wands) in the future position suggesting fire turning into the main elemental of your life … And so with this reading, we can see that future already occurring, it seems. It’s certainly a reinforcement.  

 
## RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ALL THREE

**A) Past and Present**

This card signifies the amazing amount of stamina you have; that stamina of holding onto a love for the same person for so long. You still stand strong. You have some bruises to your body, mainly from the fact your love is unreciprocated, but it’s “just a scratch”. You can still stand up and latch onto the Wand you have. Nothing is stopping you from continuing on admiring the man you love so much. 
The 9W also means the rejection you faced when you asked him out, and found out he is already in a relationship. That might have wounded you, but it didn’t deter you from hoping. The Wand you hold onto is still there, keeping you up. The subtle fiery passion you have within your soul continues to flicker. However, you are guarded. You’ll be more careful around this man, now knowing he’s in a relationship. Every move can ruin the possibilities you could have with him. For now you are observing the setting from afar, and keeping a low guard to prevent any more wounds. 

**B) Present and Future**

You don’t need something or someone else controlling your fate. If we looked at the WOF separately, it would be reasonable to say that you’d have to leave your life up to the strings that tug your destiny. But with the Empress on your side, you have the power to make your own outcome. The Empress is showing you have a lot more power than you think you do. Some things you might not be able to change, because the WOF is beyond human grasp and in its own personal realm, however changes or transformation that occur on the humans physical plane will permit you to grab and shake those changes to your fancy. You don’t need to take something you don’t like; you can manipulate it, as long as it resides on the human realm of possibilities. 

## SOULMATE ANALYSIS:

In this section, I will discuss the analysis of whether the man you have loved for so long, has some sort of soul mate connection with you.

First, a big theory in modern spiritual thought is the idea that we all have more than one soul mate. Some soul mates are our teachers or family members, or people we spend a lot of time with. We tend to either break or make long lasting bonds with these soul mates. We meet with them to learn valuable lessons in our life.

I personally don’t agree these people are our soul mates. There’s another factor we must consider here: the concept of a Twin Flame. So while many spiritual people think soul mates are people we learn lessons from, they have created a new idea to compensate for the concept of an eternal lover. Twin Flames are what we really mean to call our romantic soul mate… this phrase has replaced the soul mate term in our modern times. Twin Flames are eternal lovers that are ‘one’, but they are in separate bodies. Sometimes they never meet each other in life, but they are supposed to … at a certain time, usually when karmic ties have unbounded and they are ready to be with each other. It’s not always easy with Twin Flame though. There are a lot of things that try to break them apart. 

For the sake of simplicity, we will use the term soul mate.

Now, onto the actual analysis of what the Tarot says. I drew an extra card, specifically asking if you had some sort of past connection with this man, because the initial spread gave no indication as to whether he was your soul mate or not.  

<img src="{{ stuffostuff.com }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/content/judgement.jpg" alt="">

_Judgement was drawn_
 
The answer is Yes. You did have a past connection with this man. You did well with listening to your inner voice – intuition -. 
The connection is showing itself right now, since you’ve known him for so long. Judgement deals a lot with karma in this case. When we have past connections with others, we have a shared relationship built on karma. The karma could be good or bad. That is revealed in time, through the dealings you have with the individual. You have known him for so long, retaining some sort of communication with him so there is a definite reason you are drawn to him. Judgement is saying through time, this relationship will reveal itself, blaringly loud. Just like how the divine figure is trumpeting it’s ‘announcement’ throughout the Earth, to all the fellow humans. It’ll be a coming for you.


 
## CONCLUSION

Because of the WOF is in the future position, the Tarot is saying a change is arriving, regarding your relationship with the man you love. How long it will take for this change depends. Generally when I do a past, present and future reading, the future tends to take more than half of a year to reveal itself (there are always exceptions). Not “occur” but reveals itself. Things are revealed to you, and you can either take that opportunity or flee from it. As well, every Tarot reading is a snapshot of the present moment. Yes, it may give insight into the future, but that possible future is dependent on the present you. If you take a different path (and if you can hear your intuition well, you’ll know), then the future will be entirely different from what you thought it would be. Keep that in mind. 

He has a girlfriend right now, so timing is everything. Fortunately, the Tarot is giving you hope. Not every single little thing will be left up for you to do. The WOF will help with the abstract, due to its divine nature. You just don’t know what area the Wheel will land on. If in the future, you’re dissatisfied with the place the Wheel landed on, remember the Empress has given you a one up. Don’t ever think you don’t have power. It’s clear to me you do have a lot of innate power, from seeing this spread and the past spread. You just need to discover and properly utilize it. 

To briefly sum up: A relationship is certainly a possibility. A definite yes or no is unclear, right now, because he is wrapped up in his own relationship. The Tarot says to retain the power of the Empress, cultivate the love, watch closely but don’t make any sudden moves because the WOF will guide you with that. Just like in your last reading you received 5W, telling you to be carefree. The same goes for this reading. Let the WOF do what it needs to do. And with the Judgement card that I drew, it could very well mean all that karmic energy that has been held will finally release into what needs to be done … and that is a closer relationship to this man. The relationship would most likely start out as a tighter bond as in friendship, but could easily move onto more ONLY if the WOF lands on the section of fate that permits it. But even if it doesn’t, don’t give up hope either, since you could have the power to wedge that Wheel just a smidgen to your favour. Just a small prick can change everything and cause the Wheel to change again. 

## Closing

I do hope this has given you some insight into your relationship with the man you have been harboring a love towards. I was very glad to have the opportunity to provide this reading for you since love matters are something I enjoy most of all. Love is a fascinating phenomenon humans get to experience.

Cheers,

-April
