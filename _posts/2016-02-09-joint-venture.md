I’ve finished this more ‘ creative ‘ piece, first detailed in Cerulean Sketches. View that post to see the compositions. I like how it turned out. I didn’t want it to be cut and dry, as in, extremely clean and careful. So I let myself go, which I am getting better at. As an illustrator, it’s good to veer away from the usual things, because what I’ve learned from doing this piece, I will use for future pieces.

## Dislike for Mistakes

When I was younger, I hated any kind of mistake in my work. A small line here, and then a wrong mark there … it drove me. But look at how unclean this stuff is. There’s smudges of different colours in the background; it’s not a clear cerulean. I tried to mimic a natural painted look. It was easy to let go of what my younger self would think, “small mistakes”, in order to retain an organic appearance. The organic appearance is noted with a ‘flow’ that can be detected when analyzing the piece. Indeed, the shapes are angular – sharp and pointed, harbouring a stiff aesthetic – but the overall picture flows inward to expel a coordinated visual. 

## Character Insight

The characters are Sigmana (long hair), and the twin, Phirem (short hair). I seem to always draw young Sigmana with its face lifted up, and Phirem’s face lowered … but that’s due to how strong their personality impacts my representation of them. Sigmana is a curious creature and being the prototype for its twin, Phirem, is in a constant mode of wonder. Phirem is quite the opposite – there’s no ‘wonder’ of the universe grounding it, but more of desire for the universe wondering at Phirem. That could be why I unconsciously drew Phirem’s hands the way I did, the form of “creating power”, although it looks odd. 

# Progress

In summary, the angular lines are becoming clearer in my work. Liberal use of triangular, hard shapes. And then there are still flowing shapes, for example, the garments the two twins wear, as well as their hair. I just wanted for this to be a shape picture; more a practice of my techniques and skill. How far I can go with being uncomfortable. Not one ounce of discomfort arose while working on this piece. So, I would say this was a successful maneuver. 
There are not many work in process pictures, simply because this work is not an ‘accurate’ work; it didn’t call for many precise revisions to achieve the final state. It was an ‘inaccurate’ work, meaning, the work is the way it is, liberally worked on using more of the mind and flows of the hand rather than including a logical set of steps to complete it.
