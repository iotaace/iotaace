Here’s variance number 4. I suppose I skipped number 3 too soon.
The International Accounting Concept midterm exam was due today. So I am turning this in as well.

Not here not there, not where.

Sigmana is the feature. This stemmed from a montage of sketches I wanted to do of Sigmana and Phirem. This one was a sketch I wanted to completely develop.

I retained the sketchy background, though reducing the opacity to 39%. It gives it a good edge, messy, gritty, rich. It’s too smooth without it. And I like the way the orange clashes with the red, though the red mixes with the weak blue carefully. The weak blue is on a different saturation level from the red, but the red pops within the confines of the blues.

The original size of the image is huge: **4000 x 4800**. But here it’s down to 11% of its original size. Additionally a few adjustments to the originals curves allowing the light to be equal amongst the darks was done.

And there’s that.
