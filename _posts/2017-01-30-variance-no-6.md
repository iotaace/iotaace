    title: Variance Number 6
---

I set this variance as the header for the splash page of my portfolio. This is a bold and bizarre piece that I had sketched out back in August. But it was only in January this year that I completed it, thanks to time permitting.

A common theme I like to draw are the twins, Sigmana and Phirem. I like to draw them because I can make them look disheveled, bizarre, unconventional. I'm tired of seeing artists draw characters that look like picture perfect models, and from the other side of the spectrum, uninteresting "shapes". One of my influences for making the delicate creatures is Nagano Mamoru illustrations of his characters. Particularly, his Fatima's look haunting. 

Anyways, I tried to pick print safe colours, but, because I had this image on the backburner for months, I didn't care when I picked it up again a few weeks ago. Nevertheless, I kept the palette at a minimum and chose vibrant, almost jarring colours. When I do a variance painting, I like to choose colours that may not work next to each other. Sometimes colours we think are disharmonious together, can be used to support or emphasize on another colour. I played it safe with this piece, though. Sigmana's dull blue hair is a great contrast to the hot pink background.

This is another large image (6500 x 3300). A larger view is accessible through the gallery, in the portfolio section.
