I always manage to find time to work on my stuff.

I have for the longest time (many, many years), wanted to make a more ‘artistic’ piece, where the main colour was a blaring cerulean. A lot of times I let colour guide the entire process of the picture, and it can really change the way the picture was originally set out to be. The picture is the colour and it is entirely based on the colour. Without the colour, there’s no statement and no character, or story.

The cerulean piece in question: Sigmana (long hair) and Phirem (short hair), right when they are out of their artificial intelligence machines. Their mother is watching them from beyond with her unwavering glare. They are aliens, so they aren’t supposed to be beautiful. I want the eyes and lips and overall face to look weary for all of them. The mother has bulging eyes and long paper-thin eyelashes. I want to make the mother look as stoic but uncanny as possible. 
I thought I was going to do Sigmana and Phirem as line art, but then I experimented a little bit and figured doing an orange and blue paint of their silhouettes is best. Darker shadows of their bodies and garment will be the blue of the background. The mother will be the ‘prime’ target – bolder.

## Another work in progress

Here's a work in progress which stirred from an idea I had two years ago. I had a dream and after I woke up; I sketched the picture. The character was in a weird cavern that was full of muscles, cells, nervous system … hair separated from the head. So I used my character Phirem. Phirem is an alien, a creation, so it’s impossible Phirem has the inners of a human or any kind of organic being but inorganic material circuiting through.
Right now it’s just a line art of the body but as you can see by this sketch:

after the body base will be completed, a layer will be drawn on top consisting of sinewy threads.  The body base is made so it will be easier ... I need to remind myself not to make the line art ‘too’ perfect. Ctrl-z, draw, ctrl-z … repeat.

More on these as I continue to work through them.
