## Setting the tone

This is a very simple piece. Another written image, similar to the Jellyfish. One can say it’s the grownup version of the standard child’s drawing of a hill, house, sun, tree and stick figure, due to the horizontal composition. Much of the inspiration came from a dedicated video of Tuxedomoon’s piece “Lowlands Tone Poem”, and a house I would walk by as I went to the grocery store. The house looked standard of the area where my university is located; shabby, but it had a unique charm to it: many sunflowers right out front. I thought, ‘this house is not American’.

## His emotions

His appearance here amongst the minimal setting fleshes his personality completely. He isn’t depressed, and he isn’t a sad fellow. He isn’t happy either. He just is what he is. I think that’s the best way to live life, not to have so many ups and downs. Going through life as an active observer and aware of your environment, you tend to be content, forgiving of other people, and generally an easy going person. These types of individuals are not wishy-washy; they aren’t ecstatic, nor wild or morose. 

## Background on the creation 

As for the creation of the image: the image is huge - 4748 x 3500 pixels. Not a good idea to draw this large with black and white work. It took a very long time and at some points, the work was exceedingly tedious and painful. Drawing each individual sunflower was a pretty bad experience. I spent a few weeks mulling over how I would plan out the sunflowers and I had difficulty drawing them at first (after some practice, I figured out my way of drawing these bright flowers). I was frustrated, and kept flip flopping between not including the flowers in the picture. I wagered the picture simply is not the same without the sunflowers – after all, it is my primary inspiration for the piece. After the initial line work was complete, the drawing went smoothly. To make the effect of the body of the sunflower, I simply laid over a noise layer. There’s no way I’d do each individual dot for each sunflower. Pure masochism.    

There was going to be a street lamp, but maybe it would crowd the picture. On a second thought, perhaps I should have added it. There’s also no blue shed either, though I imagine he’s coming close to it. The priority was on the sunflowers and sky.  

Similarly, I too walk with an umbrella and briefcase.
