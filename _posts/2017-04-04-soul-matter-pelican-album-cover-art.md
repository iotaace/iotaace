In the past month, I've been trying to get some freelance work as an illustrator. Most of the requests I've gotten (which weren't many, since I'm currently only using Craigslist, but hope to further my endeavours after the end of my other freelance project) were for logo design, even though I advertise illustrations. In any case, I have gotten some work ... not much, but the best deal I've gotten was to do an album art cover for Soul Matter second album, music by an independent artist, Trevor Hougardy. 

I spent a few weeks working on this piece. Since I have seen and been working on it for a while, I’m not impressed by it; a feeling that is not uncommon with anyone who has a creative bent. I also would have preferred not to have lineart with a painted look. 

The concept behind this was a grand appearance, dynamic feel of flying in the air, in order to match with the music. A pelican is flying into the canyons, out from the forest. There's also water near the canyons. Pelican’s and canyons don’t mix, but with water they do. It's unusual idea, but I think it worked very well. This piece is a little conventional, but the pelican adds to an abstract expression. 

Originally the work was optimized to be black and white, though the request was to paint it in colour with an inkling of 70s faded colours, similar to folk colours. A couple of problems with the creation of the work: black lineart on clouds with painted look doesn’t necessarily look good because it decreases the fluffy tenderness of cloud’s inherent nature. The clouds have to be tender, so the lineart was coloured various shades. A second problem, that I feel always plagues black lineart mixed with paint, is the black lineart lends to a ‘grittier’ look to a picture. 

I also recreated the title in Illustrator.

All in all, I feel this was a good step towards more commercial work. I hope it provides a little bit of exposure. In the meanwhile, a lot of work, as always, is to be done to improve my skill.
