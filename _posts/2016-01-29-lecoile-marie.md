More of my characters from my sci-fi story. This time it’s teenage (about 19 years old) LeCoile and Marie. LeCoile is a fairly effeminate male, but does it matter in the year 3700 AD~? And Marie has been on this page, in the 80s retrospective (link). She’s a mechanical engineer; has a sort of anarchist personality, very chaotic neutral I’d say. Her mother is a famous scientist part of the “Inverts” science group, made up of 4 other genius scientists put together by the world leaders. Because of this, Marie didn’t see her mother a lot as a child, so she spent time living next door to LeCoile’s family (who also, are scientists, but local). At her teenage years, she hasn’t seen her mother since she was 8~ yrs. And the whereabouts of her father are unknown. 

They live next to a massive ocean, but it can get cold during the fall and winter!

I enjoyed working on the gnarly tree the most in this picture.

At first, I was at a lost where to start, but I had to get over the mental block and go wild. I’d like to go wilder, but one has to be careful where to place the lines and shading as well (which is where the initial mental block arose). You can’t just place any line anywhere. And if you already made lines, in the line art base, it might not look right when you shade the picture. It’s better to have a fairly blank slate to work with, and simply transfer the image from your mind into the picture. Most importantly, the mental block has to be removed. You can’t think to yourself how the picture will look every second you place a line. Do it first and then look at it 5 minutes later. Erase if you don’t like it (hopefully not, because then 5 minutes are lost). I try to erase the least possible but sometimes I really don’t like the way I did a shading so I redo it all over again. A lot of time is lost doing this, but it gives my mind a ‘drug’ to calm down. I’m working on it.

This picture has been in my ‘file cabinet’ for several months. Most of the picture was completed in November. Once again, the mental block worked against me in the completing it, but I fought through this month and finally finished it thoroughly afterwards. The picture was first created Tuesday, October 27, 2015 … and finished at the end of January this month.
