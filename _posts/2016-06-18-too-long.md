Just took too long for something so simple. There were a lot of mental ebbs and flows during the first half of June.

This is Cruise Captain Jessie (space opera character). Jessie, in a more caricature depiction, is in an earlier post titled 80s Retrospective.

Jessie is an Andromedian, and is a licensed Cruise Captain. She operates her own cruise line business with her own ship named Enlighters. Most people in my space opera world can teleport to wherever they want between MWG, Andromeda and Triangulum (as long as they teleport to the proper points of references that are accepted by the computer systems) but relaxing cruises throughout space is big business. People from all over it love it, and they can casually communicate with other species which is not often available. 

Enlighters cruises between Milky Way and Andromeda. Usually, the ship follows its own unique course and it teleports to a set of progressed points in its journey, where it cruises for a certain amount of time, highlighting some celestial objects, then teleports to the next point to speed up; at the end, it retraces its path and ends up at the docking station. 

The ship is massive and is almost like a planet in the nature that it has everything that can please the space tourists. It has to please tourists from alien and like cultures. Typically Enlighters cruise duration is one week. There are off seasons when the ship needs to be repaired or updated. Actually, Jessie’s ship is acting as an outdated model, but its internals have been updated. Passengers have always been charmed by Enlighters old world quality.

Enough of talking about the ship.

My idea with the picture was to make it like a photo you see in a magazine or brochure. The cruise pass is in that shape, just larger and with a glaring advertisement on the face. Cruise Captain Jessie is next to it. Her hat has always been based off of aviation but her suit is navy like. 

This is her rough outfit:

‘Realistic’ meaning her hair is not as light blue as it was in the cartoon like version in the linked article above. Generally, when I want to make something serious I make sure the colours aren’t over the top unless it truly is part of that character’s personality. 

Overall, it’s another black and white picture to practice black and white. A coloured version wouldn’t be a bad idea, but I have to move on to other pictures that need to be done.
