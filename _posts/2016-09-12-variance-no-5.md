Each time I look at this picture I get the sense of – dryness –. Certain amount of ugliness. There’s enough vibrancy to ensure this picture will gather the attention of those that enjoy neon colour schemes, but it is subdued by the dull background – pale mauve, gray periwinkle and a midnight blue: light enough to share the same space with the mauve and periwinkle.

This is also my first definite picture to incorporate only CMYK values. They were selected from the Pantone +CMYK library. It worked pretty well. This was the palette I worked with:

The only colour I didn’t use was the light green. 
I proofed the image, and only the green in the man’s cloak dulls a tad; the green was mixed too much with the blue while painting, so the green, which is greenish-blue, does not properly come out when switched to CMYK. The rest of the colours keep consistent.
The initial concept came from a sketch I drew in an old sketch book of mine, back in 2014. I probably sketched it in one of my art classes and I was going to eventually plan it out as an image but I never did. The character is Wolfe, a shape shifter. Two years later, and here is a much nicer rendition of the original. I do not have this sketch book with me currently so no scan of the original is available. 
A black and white creation of the image might be done.
