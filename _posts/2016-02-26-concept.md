After two weeks I have time to post some stuff I’m working on. The main work is my newest ‘more creative’ work, after the great practice Cerulean Twins provided. 
Before I post it, here are some other things of interest.

## Sigmana's Original Outfit

Concept of Sigmana in formal wear. It’s a very 70s-80s design. Probably all my designs are heavily inspired by the 80s, but what can I do? The theme, if noticeable on first observance, are primary colours. I’ve always liked Sigmana’s primary colour outfit. The golden skirt is metallic, and half open. Not part of S’s dress; it’s simply added, making S’s regular dress formal. That’s all there is to it.

In my story, S isn’t particularly keen of the formal additions; it’s quite trite. Her skirt of the dress is my favourite part… it’s big and fluffy, reminiscent of the 1950s. In the future, they don’t wear crinolines though, so activity is not hampered.

Next is Iota and the gang. I still don’t know what to do with this picture. It might be colour, it might be black and white. I’m leaning towards colour, because I’d like to do one colour picture showcasing Iota’s gang. Anyways, I like Iota’s face here. For several years I had been trying to draw him realistic, but my skills weren’t able to translate what was in my mind. Now, this right here, is what I think he’d look like in real life.
