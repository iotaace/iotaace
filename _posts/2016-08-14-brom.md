I’m trying to come up with a comfortable, conventional colouring style that involves some sort of line art. I’ve spent too much time with black and white so I am lacking. With this piece, I decided to use my Variance style, twisting it to make it less abstract. More importantly, this is a concept character design (that I redid three times) and was great colouring practice. 

## Space Detective Brom

Here is Brom, a concept art of a character. He’s a space detective and has a cyborg eye. Well I didn’t want the eye to look so mechanical and average. So it’s simply blue, though his eye changes colours depending on what wavelength he needs to hone in on. Blue is for visible light. He looks pretty regular as far as detectives go, besides his hair. I realized too late that his hair bears a little resemblance to Professor Oak… Ahh, well I did want Brom to have a ‘cyberpunk’ hair style. Sleek hair is popular in fashion today, but not popular with me.  

## Overlay manipulation

Another good practice was overlay manipulation to get some above standard effects. It was boring with just the colouring. I like the texture I gave to the coat, as well as some dirt to the shoes.
There were a lot of revisions with this picture. Check them out here (this was the cause for the unbelievable long time it took to finish his design):
