This is Variance Number Second. Actually, the first one was posted already, however I didn’t conjure the name to describe the style at the time. 

Cerulean Twins is Variance Number One.

## Dark Colours

{% include gallery id="gallery" caption="Dark portrait" %}

I finished this back in March; it’s only till now I feel like posting it. It’s a dark picture, isn’t it? I think it’s one of my mistakes. It looks like a filter has been applied, but really, those are the colours I picked. 

As I have been writing this entry, I fixed it with curves. This is what it’s supposed to look like.

I had to be gentle with the curves. The painting needs to keep its warmness, but avoid being too saturated. The stark red and purplish pinks can cause that if you’re not careful. 

These are the colour tables. The first one is the original, and the second is the newest one.

Change the picture to index mode and you can view the big picture – the colour table. The second table is more consistent... enough vibrancy to contrast with the duller colours. The first table doesn’t have many vibrant colours flowing with the dull. A little depressing.
Colour table comparisons are a great analysis tool; helps discover problems with images.

I like both versions but it’s easier to see the details in the lighter picture. Additionally, most people would find the first picture simply too dark.

Better to avoid those situations by improving.
As for the image itself, I wanted to pick colours that matched the personality of the person. Most of the colours are muted, but there are the splashes and that’s what count when it comes to personality. Those vibrant lights come forth, minimizing the fortified wall.
  
Bonus funky:

## A tip:
Don’t paint when the laptop light is below 100% brightness or less than an optimal amount.
